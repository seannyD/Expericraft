# Fixing problems

## Flying

In creative mode (see below), you can fly by hitting space bar twice.  Hold the space bar to rise and hold shift (crouch) to descend.

## I need a particular block type

Press 'e' (or maybe 'i') to open the inventory.  Click and drag any of the blocks into your inventory on the bottom.  The special blocks for this expeirment are at the bottom of the "building blocks" tab (first tab).


## In Minecraft, when trying to use the console, I can't type some characters (a, c)

Minecraft thinks the command button is being held down.  Press the apple command key or the windows control key or the windows key on its own, then try typing again.


## Changing to creative mode

Player A can switch to creative mode using the command line:

`/gamemode creative`  To set to creative mode.

`/gamemode survival` To set back to normal.

But player B doesn't have permission to do this.  Instead, switch to experiment mode:

`/experiment`

And that will put the player into creative mode.
