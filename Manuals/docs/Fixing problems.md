# Fixing problems

## In Minecraft, when trying to use the console, I can't type some characters (a, c)

Minecraft thinks the apple command button is being held down.  Press the apple command key on its own, then try typing again.


## Changing to creative mode

First you need to give permission for the player to use the console commands.  In the command prompt where the server is running, type `op` followed by the name of the player:

`op Seanny_D`

or

`op LizIrv`

The player can now type a forward slash to get the console, then 

`/gamemode creative`  To set to creative mode.

`/gamemode survival` To set back to normal.


## Server commands

`difficulty peaceful` 

`clear LizIrv`

`give LizIrv minecraft:wool 64 0`
